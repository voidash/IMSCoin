## IMSToken
It is a ERC-20 Token. ERC-20 is a standard for fungible tokens in ethereum blockchain. Fungible means each token is exactly the same as any other token.
IMSToken is redeemed when users buy and get receipt from the stores that has deployed IMS Software. Once deployed to Main Ethereum network it can have actual value.
The token is simple enough and doesn't promise anything extra functional or innovative. Currently it is functioning  only as a reward points. But this can be much more than that.
